# LAMMPShade
LAMMPShade aims to be a toolkit for working with LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) simulations.
It's an open source library designed to collect useful functions to analyze and convert OUTPUT files and (possibly in the future) generate INPUT files in a fast and efficient way.
In its current state LAMMPShade is able to read YAML-like output, convert them in XYZ files for third-party visualization softwares and create preliminary plots to analyze the data from each step of a LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation.

## How to install
You can download the repo and use it as a simple Python package.
Testing and evaluation of more modules is still considered, once it is done the package will be uploaded to pypi.

## Dependencies
LAMMPShade is tested and working in Python `3.11`.
Functionality with older versions is not assured, but will be tested.

LAMMPShade relies on the following dependencies:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

Be sure to have them properly installed beforehand.
